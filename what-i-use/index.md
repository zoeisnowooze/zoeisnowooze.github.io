# What I use

### Computers

There are currently two working computers that are being used. The main desktop tower where I'm typing this right now, and an older system
that serves as a creation station for the kids.

<dl>
<dt>Desktop tower</dt>
<dd>
    <p>This runs Debian 13 (trixie) in anticipation of the release later this year. The main desktop environment is currently GNOME 47 on X11 because
    that what works the most reliably on proprietary NVidia drivers (boooo).</p>
    <p>The machine contains:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ASUS TUF Gaming X570-PLUS motherboard</li>
        <li>AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU</li>
        <li>32 GB of DDR4-3600 RAM</li>
        <li>250 GB WD Black SN750 NVMe storage for the OS</li>
        <li>1 TB GB WD Black SN750 NVMe storage for user data</li>
        <li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER</li>
        <li>Keychron K8 Pro keyboard, with Mintlodica DSA Witch Girl keycaps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In a typical work session I would use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A Zsh shell, with Oh My Zsh</li>
        <li>Vim as a text editor and development environment</li>
        <li>WezTerm for the terminal emulation, with multiple tabs per window</li>
        <li>Firefox for web browsing needs, and used instead of standalone apps (that is, Discord and Mastodon)</li>
        <li>KiCad, OpenSCAD, Inkscape, and PrusaSlicer for making things</li>
    </ul>
</dd>

### Electronics station

Most of the equipement I'm using for making has been acquired two decades ago when I used to live in a larger appartment, or
when we got the house. It's a mix of old and trusted, and pretty new stuff.

<dl>
<dt>Weller WESD51 soldering iron</dt>
<dd>
    <p>This soldering station had lost its temperature knob and has my very first 3D print as a replacement. I don't see a
    reason to replace it at the scale of any of my projects.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Hakko FA-400 smoke absorber</dt>
<dd>
    <p>It's a basic extraction system that seems to be good enough in a well-ventilated room so that my air quality monitor doesn't notice the flux fumes.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Greenlee "1105" wire stripper and cutter</dt>
<dd>
    <p>Sometimes used for stripping wire insulation, but mostly for forming leads of through-hole components, or as general purpose pliers. It's always next to
    the soldering station.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Hony HY-150 "automatic self-adjusting" wire stripper and cutter<dt>
<dd>
    <p>This is the fancy wire stripping tool from Adafruit. Somehow I haven't had to use one that much since I got it two years ago.</p>
</dd>

<dt>VOMM 3616 AA SA-ESD tweezers</dt>
<dd>
    <p>This is the pair of tweezers that I've been using since forever and they still look great. I accidentally bent the tip once, but it still works perfectly.</p>
</dd>

<dt>CHP 170 diagonal cutters</dt>
<dd>
    <p>Pretty much the essential tool if I'm building a through-hole board. There's always a pair of safety glasses that are stored with it. These days I have a couple
    of older cutters that I keep for preparing 3D printing filament, or any use where there's a risk of damaging the blades.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Stickvise</dt>
<dd>
    <p>The board holder I will use most frequently these days. I got frustrated with the PanaVise 201 that I had when I started.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Fluke 179 digital multimeter</dt>
<dd>
    <p>I learned to test and probe circuits on older Fluke 70 multimeters, so I got a fancy kit for myself. I use it to test and troubleshoot circuits (mostly continuity, with the audible signal), or measure component values.</p>
</dd>

<dt>MG Chemicals 852 brush</dt>
<dd>
    <p>This is the brush I use to remove the water-soluble flux. I used to use old toothbrushes for this purpose.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Kester 331 Water-Soluble solder</dt>
<dd>
    <p>This flux is easy to remove under running water, and we have an extra sink in the basement that can be used for that purpose. I will clean up boards after
    every soldering sessions.</p>
    <p>Note that this is leaded solder. I still use this because I bought it around 2003 and haven't yet used more than a third of it.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Kester 245 No-Clean solder</dt>
<dd>
    <p>The No-Clean version is used in the later steps of a projects, where components such as potentiometers, switches, and various connectors would have issues if
    put under water.</p>
